# PRODIGY_WD_01
This repository contains all the coding files I wrote to create a responsive landing page as per the requirements given by Prodigy InfoTech.
The task was to design a landing page that was interactive and dynamic in nature. So, I created a web page that contained details of my hobbies and interests and designed it as per the requirements. In creating this repository for a responsive landing page, I honed my skills in HTML for structuring content, CSS for styling and responsiveness, and JavaScript for interactivity. I gained practical experience in designing user-friendly interfaces and implementing dynamic features to meet specific project requirements, enhancing my proficiency in web development and design.
